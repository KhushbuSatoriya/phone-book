# Trie-Data-structure
Trie is a tree-based data structure, which is used for efficient retrieval of a key in a large dataset of strings.

# Trie
Data structure and relevant algorithms for extremely fast prefix/fuzzy string searching.

Trie is an efficient information retrieval data structure. Using Trie, search complexities can be brought to optimal limit (key length). 

If we store keys in a binary search tree, a well balanced BST will need time proportional to M * log N, where M is the maximum string length and N is the number of keys in the tree.
